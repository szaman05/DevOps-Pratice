# Auto Scaling Group:

Q: How can you launch 3 ec2 instances in 3 separate AZs at once?

A: Create a Launch Template with Spread/ Partition placement group
Create ASG select subnets in different AZs, enter 3 as desired capacity
and 3 as max capacity and Create it without any target tracking scaling
policy. It will launch 3 instances with 3 AZs. Point to note we just
need to delete the ASG to terminate the instances.

Q: How can we launch a number of instances based on a time range?

A: After creating an auto scaling group we can create scheduled scaling
policy; this option is not available during the time of creation. Itâ€™s
kind of overwrite the actual policy based on time condition. Also, for
every task we have to create single policy. Such as to launch in
specific time 1 policy to stop in specific time another policy.

Most of the Advanced Configurations in ASG we have to do after the
creation of ASG. Such as: Termination policy, Suspension process etc.

**Lifecycle Hooks:**

Lifecycle hooks help you perform custom actions on instances as they
launch and before they terminate.

**Active instance refresh:**

Instance refresh performs rolling updates on the Auto Scaling group's
instances. Only one instance refresh can be active at a time.

**Scaling Cooldowns:**

-   After a scaling activity happens, you are in the cooldown period
    (default 300 seconds).

-   During the cooldown period, the ASG will not launch or terminate
    additional instances (to allow for metrics to stabilize).

-   Use a ready-to-use AMI to reduce configuration time in order to be
    serving request fasters and reduce the cooldown period.
